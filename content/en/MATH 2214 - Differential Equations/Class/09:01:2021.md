## Existence and Uniqueness theorem

Suppose *p* and *q* are functions continuous on $(a,b)$. Also assume $a<x_0<b$. Then the IVP $\frac{dy}{dx}+p(x)y=q(x), y(x_0)=y_0$ Has a unique solution on $(a,b)$ 

### Example 2

Find the largest open interval we know there exists a unique solution $\frac{dy}{dx} + \frac{1}{x(x+2)}y=\frac{1}{x-5}, y(3)=1$

Where are P and Q not continuous? Discontinuities at $x=[0,-2,5]$

Because the initial condition is at $x=3$, the interval must contain that point. By the existence uniqueness theorem , the interval of existence is $(0,5)$. We also know a unique solution exists by the EUT theorem on this interval.



## Solving first order linear ODE

Consider $\frac{dy}{dx} + p(x)y=q(x)$

Multiply both sides by an **integrating factor**: $e^{\int p(x) dx}$

Reverse the product rule:

$\frac{dy}{dx} e^{\int p(x)dx}+yp(x)e^{\int p(x)dx}= q(x) e ^{\int p(x)dx}$

### Example 1

Solve the IVP

$\frac{dy}{dx}+2xy=4x, y(0)=5$

Recall $\frac{dy}{dx}(ye^{\int 2xdx})= q(x) e^{\int 2x dx}$

$\frac{d}{dx} (y e^{x^2+c})=4xe^{x^2+c}$

$ye^{x^2}=\int 4xe^{x^2}dx$

$ye^{x^2}=\int 2e^{x^2}+c$

# Real World Applications

## Population

$\frac{dp}{dt}=kP$

$\ln(P) = kt+c$

$P(t)=e^{kt+c}$

$P(t) = P_0 e^{kt}$

### Example 1 

Suppose that in two days a population of bacterial in a Petri dish has grown from 100,00o to 150,000. Estimate the bacteria population after 7 days.

$P=N_o e^{rt}$

$150,000=100,000e^{2r}$

$r=\frac{1}{2}\ln(\frac{3}{2})$

$P(7)=100,000 e^{7 \frac{1}{2} \ln(\frac{3}{2})}$

$=100,000(\frac{3}{2}^\frac{7}{2}) \approx 413,361$

## Radioactive decay

$\frac{DQ}{dt} = -kQ, k>0$

### Example 2

Suppose the quantity of a radioactive substance decreases from 50mg to 43mg after 5 days. How much will remain after 30 days.

$Q(t)=Q_o e^{-rt}$ where *t* is measured in days and $Q_0 = Q_0 = 50mg$ 

$ans \approx 20.23 mg$
