## Drag/Terminal Velocity

$$
m\frac{dv}{dt} = -mg - kv(t), v(0) = v_0\\
v(t)= \frac{-mg}{k}+(v_0+\frac{mg}{k})e^{-kt/m}
$$

Whether the object is initially moving up or down, it eventually begins to fall and approach terminal velocity. The instant before it strikes the ground it has the **impact velocity**.

Once the impact occurs, the initial value problem is no longer applicable.



## First Order Linear Differential Equations

$$
\frac{dy}{dx}+p(x)y=q(x), a<x<b
$$

Homogeneous if and only if $q(x)= 0$. If it cannot be written in this form then its **nonlinear**.

### Example 1:

Determine the linearity and homogeneity of each of the following

1. $\frac{dy}{dx} = xy^2$ - nonlinear because of the quadratic $y^2$
2. $\frac{dy}{dx} = x^2y$ - linear with $p(x) = -x^2$. It is also homogenous.
3. $\cos(x)\frac{dy}{dx} + e^xy = \tan(x)$
   1. Linearize: $\frac{dy}{dx}+ \frac{e^x}{\cos(x)}y=\frac{\tan(x)}{\cos(x)}$
   2. Nonhomogeneous linear 
4. $\frac{1}{y}\frac{dy}{dx} + x^3 = \sin(x)$  
   1. Can be linearized and is linear
