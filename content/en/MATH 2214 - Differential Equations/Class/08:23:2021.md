# Differential Equations

These equations describe physical processes as mathematical models.

- Decay of radioactive substances
- Electrical networks
- Population dynamics
- Dispersion of pollutants
- Trajectories of moving objects

## Examples

### Newtons Second Law of Motion

$$
F=ma\\
\text{Write as diff eq for position}\\
f(t,y,\frac{dy}{dt})= m\frac{d^2y}{dt^2}\\
\text{Position is y}
$$

### Linear motion due to gravity

Let g denote constant acceleration due to gravity - approx $9.8 m/s^2$
$$
weight = -mg\\
m\frac{d^2y}{dt^2} = -mg\ \text{because } \frac{d^2y}{dt^2} \text{ is acceleration (mg=ma and mg=F)}\\
\frac{d^2y}{dt^2}=-g\\
\frac{dy}{dt} = -gt + v_0,\ v_0\ \text{is initial velocity at}\ t=0\\
y=-\frac{1}{2}gt^2=v_0t+y_0,\ y_0\ \text{is initial position at}\ t=0
$$

### Radioactive Decay

$$
\frac{dQ}{dt} = -kQ\\
k>0\ \text{proportionality constant. Q is the amount of material at time}\ t\\
\text{Solution: } Q(t) = Q_0e^{-kt}
$$

## ODE

More generally, $n^t$th Order ordinary differential equations(ODE), are of the form
$$
\frac{d^n}{d^n} = f(t,y,\frac{dy}{dt},\dots, \frac{d^{n-1}y}{dt^{n-1}})
$$

- Ordinary since theres only one variable t
- More thane variable yields partial differential equations (FDE), e.g. 1D wave equation $\frac{\partial^2u}{\partial x^2} = \frac{\partial^2y}{\partial t^2}$
- Where u is a function of time $t$ And the spacial coordinate x

## Initial Value Problems (IVP)

For example, we can show by substitution that $y=\alpha e^{-3t} + 2t + 1 $ is the general solution to $\frac{dy}{dt}+3y=6t+5$. Subject to the initial condition $y(0) = 3$ Gives the particular where $3=\alpha+1 = \alpha = 2$
